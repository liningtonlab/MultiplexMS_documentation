This documentation is intended to explain how to use the MultiplexMS - Companion tool.

In short, the tool performs three tasks:

(1) Creation of preparation tables and grids, based on a given list of sample names. 

(2) Deconvolution of a pooled samples feature table, using the beforehand created grids.

(3) Removing absent and highly abundant features from the deconvoluted feature table.



Windows and MacOS versions can be downloaded from our GitHub [repository](https://github.com/liningtonlab/MultiplexMS/releases). 

> We also provide demo data and a step-by-step instruction that shall help you understand how to use the Companion tool - download the demo data [here]( https://github.com/liningtonlab/MultiplexMS/releases/download/v1.0-presubmission/MultiplexMS_demo_data.zip).
